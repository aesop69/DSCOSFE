# DSCOSFE - Debian Sid Commands Options, Switches, Flags & Examples

## Project Description

This project aims to create a comprehensive, user-friendly, and interactive documentation system for Debian Sid commands. It provides detailed information about each command, including syntax, options, switches, flags, and usage examples, in a structured and easily navigable format.  The project uses the `man-help2html_v2.py` script to generate HTML pages from the command's man page and help output.

## Features

* **Command Pages**: Detailed pages for each command (e.g., `find`), including:

    * Help information from the command's `--help` output.
    * Full man page content.
    * Options, switches, and flags breakdown with clickable elements for deeper explanations.
    * Categorized usage examples with input/output displays.
* **Interactive Navigation**:
    * Collapsible sections for better readability.
    * Clickable options, switches, and flags elements.
    * Hover effects for interactive elements.
* **Search Functionality**: Users can quickly find commands by name, options, switches, flags or category.
* **Consistent Design**:
    * Dark/Light mode toggle.
    * Clean typography and color scheme for improved readability.
* **Offline Availability**: The documentation is designed to be fully usable offline.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

* `commands/`: Contains HTML pages for each command (e.g., `find.html`).
* `help/`: Stores the raw output of the `--help` command for each command.
* `man/`: Stores the raw content of the man pages for each command.
* `styles.css`: Contains the CSS stylesheet for the project.
* `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript for interactive elements.
* `index.html`: The main homepage with command categories and search functionality.
* `man-help2html_v2.py`: This script generates HTML documentation for a specific command from its man page and help output.
* `parse-options.py`: (Future update) This script will parse command options from the man pages.
* `chat-history.txt`: This file contains the chat history with AI assistants used during the design and creation of this project. It is intended to keep the main chat log minimal, or to start a new chat, or to use a new AI assistant.
