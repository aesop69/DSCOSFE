Let's regenerate the find page now:

Ran terminal command
data $ python3 man-help2html_v2.py --command find

Generating HTML for find...
âœ… HTML file created successfully: /home/me/CascadeProjects/debian-sid-docs/data/commands/find.html
Exit Code 0
Open in terminal

Not auto-run
The find page should now be properly generated in the commands folder with all the content populated. The color scheme should also be consistent with the index page, using different shades of orange for links and hover states. Would you like me to verify the content of the generated find.html file?
